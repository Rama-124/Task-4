# Logistic Regression Binary Classifier

## Objective
To build a binary classifier using Logistic Regression to predict whether a tumor is benign (B) or malignant (M) based on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

## Tools Used
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset
The dataset (`data.csv`) contains diagnostic measurements of breast cancer cases. The `diagnosis` column is the target, with:
- M = Malignant
- B = Benign

## Steps Performed
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Train-test split and feature standardization
3. Model training using Logistic Regression
4. Model evaluation using:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - ROC-AUC
5. Threshold tuning and sigmoid function explanation

## How to Run
Open the `logistic_regression_classifier.py`  and run
